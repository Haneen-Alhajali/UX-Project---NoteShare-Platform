## 🔍 Key Findings  

Through **semi-structured interviews** and **surveys**, we identified the following insights:  

- **📂 Scattered Notes:**  
  Students struggle with notes spread across multiple platforms (e.g., WhatsApp, Facebook, university websites).  
  *"The notes are scattered across WhatsApp, Facebook, and the university website. It’s hard to find what I need!"* – Participant 2.  

- **✅ Trust Issues:**  
  Students prefer notes from recognizable peers or trusted professors.  
  *"I trust notes from people I know or those who took the course with a trusted professor."* – Participant 3.  

- **👤 Privacy Concerns:**  
  Fear of judgment discourages students from sharing notes.  
  *"I’m afraid people will judge the quality of my notes or that I might make mistakes in the information I share."* – Participant 3.  

- **🛠️ Technical Challenges:**  
  Expired links and poor-quality scans hinder accessibility.  
  *"I stopped using my university’s platform because it became inaccessible."* – Participant 5.  

- **🌟 Motivation:**  
  Students are motivated to share notes to help peers and receive positive feedback.  
  *"What I love most about sharing notes is receiving thank-you messages and positive feedback from students who used them."* – Participant 5.

## 🚀 Recommendations  

Based on the research findings, we recommend the following features for the platform:  

1. **🌐 Centralized Platform with Advanced Search and Filtering**  
   - Organize notes by **course, professor, or keyword**.  
   - Include filters for **note type** (e.g., detailed, summarized) and **uploader reputation**.  

2. **✅ Trust-Building Mechanisms**  
   - Implement a **rating and review system** for notes.  
   - Allow **verified uploaders** (e.g., high-achieving students) to build credibility.  

3. **🛠️ Features for Organization and Usability**  
   - Add **bookmarking, annotation, and chapter division** features.  
   - Enable **offline access** and **easy navigation**.  

4. **👤 Privacy and Sharing Options**  
   - Offer **anonymous sharing** and **controlled visibility settings** (e.g., share with classmates only).  
   - Ensure **secure uploads and downloads** to protect user data.  

5. **🎮 Gamification and Rewards**  
   - Introduce a **rewards system** (e.g., badges, privileges) to encourage participation.  
   - Highlight **top contributors** to foster a sense of community.  

6. **💻 Technical Improvements**  
   - Ensure compatibility with **various file formats** (PDFs, Word Docs, PPTs).  
   - Optimize **file storage and sharing** to avoid technical issues.
